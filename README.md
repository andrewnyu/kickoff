# Kickoff

Summary:
<br>
I decided to learn web application programming using the highly recommended [Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). After learning the concepts of creating and deploying a web application, I declided to apply them into a personal project in order to fully synthesize the learnings.
