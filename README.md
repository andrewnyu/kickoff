# Kickoff
<br>

Short summary, I decided to learn web application programming using the highly recommended Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg. After learning the concepts of web application programming in Flask, I declided to apply the principles into a personal project in order to fully synthesize the learnings.
